For this assignment, I received help from Kristi, Ian W., Danny, Avikal and Geoff for assignment 1 regarding how to best plot the line in log space and then implementing the chi square test after wrangling the data on my own. I then helped pass that knowledge along to Maisha. 

For assignment 2, I noticed a small error in my original data wrangling after looking into why the visualization did not seem to reflect the numerical results. The results were actually very different from what was originally reviewed and, sadly, insignificant.
