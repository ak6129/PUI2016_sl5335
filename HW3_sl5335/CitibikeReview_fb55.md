The Null and alternative need to have measurable quantities in them. "being more likely' is not a measurable quantity.  You can choose for example average number of trips, or median, or total. But more likely does not tell me what you are going to mesure and run your tests on .

"Alternative hypothesis: women would be more likely to commute in the evening than their male counterparts
Null hypothesis: there would be no difference in the percentage of men and women commuting in the morning and evening
"

You also need a wording if the hypothesis AND A FORMULA FOR THE HYPOTHESES, e.g.:
H_0 : Something - Something else >= 0.... 

YOU NEED TO ESTABLISH THE SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL THRESHOLD AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR TEST!

Data wrangline is well done (you may want to justify your choice for communing hours), and here you extract proportions, so the appropriate tests are chi-sq or z for proportion. It seems like the result may end up being interesting!
