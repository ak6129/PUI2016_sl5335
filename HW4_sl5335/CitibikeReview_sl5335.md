a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

The null and alternative hypothesis are correctly formatted, but in certain areas of the notebook you suggest that you will prove the reason for this discrepancy (attempting to maximize use). However, the data is only able to verify whether there is or isn't a difference in mean time of ride, but does not reflect the reasoning. Some other potential causes: subscribers may ride for a shorter length of time because they know where they are going and where to find a rack to deposit their bike without extensive search or they may better understand that they can take advantage of having an unlimited pass with a per ride time limit by exchanging their bike for a different bike after their alotted time. 


b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test has not been chosen yet)

The data has the appropriate variables and has been successfully processed to remove all but the user type, trip duration and date. I think you could even remove the date column since your null and alternative hypothesis isn't interested in any discrepancy between mean time depending on day of the week, but just between the two groups as a whole. 

c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.

A t-test would be appropriate for this hypothesis as the independent variable is dichotomous (subscriber or customer) and there is one dependent variable (duration of ride is continous).
