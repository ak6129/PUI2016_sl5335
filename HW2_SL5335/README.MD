I created the python for show bus location and get bus info and helped a few people (Maisha, Francis) understand how to access the data within a JSON file in the process, which Jordan was able to help me convert into a python script for use in terminal. Mona was instrumental in helping me turn the longitudes, latitudes, stop point name and stop status into lists where it could be translated into a dataframe and then a csv.
